    "nativeName": "The <b>Ati-Atihan festival</b> is one of the oldest festivals of the Philippines, formerly celebrated about 800 years ago. It is a celebration of Santo Nino (the infant Jesus) and starts with an opening mass in church on the third Sunday of January. The best part about Ati-Atihan is the indulgence of tourists and visitors. You don’t have to merely sit on the sidelines and enjoy the show- you can very well pick up your dancing shoes and be a part of it. Everyone is invited to join the drum beats with colored and happy faces. You’ll also hear chants of \"<i>Viva! Santo Niño!</i>\" and \"<i>Hala Bira! Pwera Pasma!</i>” during this celebration.",

    "nativeName": "Celebrating Santo Nino is a big festival in the entire nation. The city of Cebu also hosts a grand festival in Santo Nino’s honour as the Ati-Atihan Sinulog Festival. ‘Sinulog’ translates to ‘like the water current’, which is the name of the step performed by dancers in the street. It goes two steps forward and one step backwards, forming a sort of water wave. The dance ritual marks the Filipino pagan past and its transition to Christianity. The festival has parties, concerts, processions, parades, food stalls, trade fairs, drum beats, and a lot of dancing. This festival brings everyone together to honour and celebrate the patron saint of Cebu.",

<br><br>
                        Geographically, Sorsogon is bordered by the provinces of Albay to the north, Masbate to the east, and Samar to the southeast. It faces the Philippine Sea on the east and the Ticao Pass on the west, which separates it from the island of Ticao.
                        <br><br>
                        The province of Sorsogon offers a diverse range of attractions.

It is part of the Bulusan Volcano Natural Park, which is a protected area known for its lush forests, hot springs, and beautiful crater lake.
                        <br><br>

Donsol, a municipality in Sorsogon, is known for its whale shark (locally known as "butanding") interaction tours. From November to June, visitors can witness these gentle giants in their natural habitat and even swim alongside them.
